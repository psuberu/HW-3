## Admistrative:

Please indicate

* Who you collaborated with:Christian, Kyler
* Roughly how much time you spent on this HW:7hrs
* What gave you the most trouble:Number 1 gave me the most trouble. Particularly understanding the exploratory data analysis,and fitting the logistic regression. I think the rest went fine.Also there were some problems when I published it, with some of the spacing between the words and the margins. My R crashed and I think was re-updated so that might have been part of the problem.
* Any comments you have: 


## Data

* You must first copy the file `profiles.csv` from `HW-2` to the `data` folder
in the `HW-3` directory
* We also consider all 222,540 songs played in the Reed College pool hall
jukebox from Nov 30, 2003 to Jan 22, 2009 (included in `HW-3` folder). 

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# DO NOT EDIT THIS SECTION!
profiles <- read.csv("data/profiles.csv", header=TRUE) %>% 
  tbl_df()
jukebox <- read.csv("data/jukebox.csv", header=TRUE) %>% 
  tbl_df()
```





## Question 1:

For this question we will be picking up from where we left off in HW-2,
specifically the OkCupid dataset.


### a)

Using your exploratory data analysis from HW-2, fit a logistic regression to
predict individual's gender and interpret your results.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
profiles <- filter(profiles, sex != "")
essays <- select(profiles, contains("essay"))
profiles <- select(profiles, -contains("essay"))
profiles <- mutate(profiles, is_female = ifelse(sex=="f", 1, 0))
profiles <- mutate(profiles,does_smoke = as.numeric(as.character(smokes)))
ggplot(data=profiles, aes(x=does_smoke, y=is_female)) +
geom_jitter(height=0.2, alpha = 0.1) +
xlim(c(50, 80)) + 
labs(title = "Smokers in Bay Area Okcupid Profiles", x = "age", y = "Is Female")
find.query <- function(char.vector, query){
which.has.query <- grep(query, char.vector, ignore.case = TRUE)
length(which.has.query) != 0
}
profile.has.query <- function(data.frame, query){
query <- tolower(query)
has.query <- apply(data.frame, 1, find.query, query=query)
return(has.query)
}
profiles$does_smoke <- profile.has.query(data.frame = essays, query = "smokes")
group_by(profiles, does_smoke) %>% 
summarise(prop_female=mean(is_female)) %>% kable(., digits = 3)

model1 <- glm(is_female ~ does_smoke, data=profiles, family=binomial, na.action = na.exclude)
l <- summary(model1)
kable(l$coef, digits = 3)

```
My results show that if the proportion of females that have smoking in their profiles is .369 while the proportion that don't have smokes in their profile .402. However this might not be an accurate EDA because most people generally dont have they are a smoker in their profiles,it is usually part of a survey.

### b)

Plot a histogram of the fitted probabilities $\widehat{p}_i$ for all users $i=1,
\ldots, n=59946$ in your dataset.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
p_hat <- fitted(model1)
ggplot(data = NULL, aes(x = p_hat)) +
geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2, col="green", 
fill="blue", 
alpha = .2) +geom_vline(xintercept = 0.5, col = "black") +
labs(title = "Fitted Probabilities Histogram", x = "P hat", y = "OK Cupid Users")
```


### c)

Use a *decision threshold* of $p^*=0.5$ to make an explicit prediction for each
user $i$'s sex and save this in a variable `predicted_sex`. In other words, for user $i$

* If $\widehat{p}_i > p^*$, set `predicted_sex = 1` i.e. they are female
* If $\widehat{p}_i < p^*$, set `predicted_sex = 0` i.e. they are male

Display a 2 x 2 contigency table of `sex` and `predicted_sex` i.e. compare the 
predicted sex to the actual sex of all users. The sum of all the elements in
your table should be $n=59946$. Comment on how well our predictions fared.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
fit_pred <- c()
for(i in 1:59946) {
if(!is.na(p_hat [i])){
if(p_hat[i] >= 0.5) {
fit_pred[i] <- 1
 }
if(p_hat[i] < 0.5) {
fit_pred[i] <- 0
}
}else{
fit_pred[i] <- NA
}
}
profiles$pred_female <- fit_pred
obs <- profiles  %>% group_by(is_female)  %>% tally()
pred <- profiles  %>% group_by(pred_female)  %>% tally()
contingency <- matrix(nrow = 4, ncol = 2)
colnames(contingency) <- c("Actual", "Predicted")
rownames(contingency) <- c("Male", "Female", "Unknown", "Sum")
contingency[1,1] <- obs[1,2][[1]]
contingency[2,1] <- obs[2,2][[1]]
contingency[4,1] <- contingency[1,1] + contingency[2,1]
contingency[1,2] <- pred[1,2][[1]]
contingency[2,2] <- pred[2,2][[1]]
contingency[3,2] <- pred[3,2][[1]]
contingency[4,2] <- contingency[1,2] + contingency[2,2] + contingency[3,2]
kable(as.data.frame(contingency))
```
Was not sure what was wrong with my model and why it was not able to predict the sex.It predicted all the sexes as male.

### d)

Say we wanted to have a **false positive rate** of about 20%, i.e. of the people
we predicted to be female, we want to be wrong no more than 20% of the time. What
decision threshold $p^*$ should we use?

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

```
Could not solve this one.




## Question 2:

Using the jukebox data, plot a time series of the number of songs played each
week over the entire time period. i.e.

* On the x-axis present actual dates (not something like Week 93, which doesn't 
mean anything to most people).
* On the y-axis present the total number of songs.

What seasonal (i.e. cyclical) patterns do you observe?

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
jukebox <- jukebox %>% mutate(Date_format = parse_date_time(date_time, "%b %d %H%M%S %y"))
jukebox1<- jukebox[ -c(7,8) ]  
jukebox1 <- jukebox1 %>% separate(Date_format, c("Date", "Time"), sep = " ")
jukebox1 <- jukebox1 %>% mutate(week = week(Date))
jukebox1 <- jukebox1 %>% mutate(year = year(Date))
songsperweek <- jukebox1  %>% group_by(year, week)  %>% tally() 
songsperweek$date <- as.Date(paste(songsperweek$year, 
songsperweek$week, 1, sep="-"), "%Y-%U-%u")
ggplot(data = songsperweek, aes(x = date, y = n)) +
geom_area() +
labs(title = "Songs Played per Week", x = "Date",y = "Number of Songs")
songsperweek <- songsperweek %>% mutate(month = month(date)) %>% select(month,n)
winter <- c(12, 1, 2)
spring <- c(3, 4, 5)
summer <- c(6, 7, 8)
autumn <- c(9, 10, 11)
songsbyseason <- songsperweek %>% 
mutate(season= 
ifelse(month %in% winter, 'winter', 
ifelse(month %in% spring, 'spring', 
ifelse(month %in% summer, 'summer', 
ifelse(month %in% autumn, 'autumn', NA)))))
ggplot(data = songsbyseason, aes(x = season, y = n)) +
geom_boxplot() +labs(title = "Songs Played by Season", x= "Season",y = "Number of Songs")

```
Wasn't sure how to get the first part to this question. However, the largest range of songs played during a season was in winter. Also the shortest range was in the summer.However on average there were more songs played during the summer than any other season.




## Question 3:

Using the jukebox data, what are the top 10 artists played during the "graveyard
shift" during the academic year? Define

* the "graveyard shift" as midnight to 8am
* the academic year as September through May (inclusive)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
jukebox1 <- jukebox1 %>% mutate(month = month(Date))
academic <- c(9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
academic_songs <- jukebox1 %>% mutate(academic = ifelse(month %in% academic, 'academic', 'break')) %>% 
filter(academic == "academic")
academic_songs <- academic_songs %>% filter(Time > "00:00:00", Time < "08:00:00")
academic_songs %>% group_by(artist) %>% 
tally() %>% arrange(desc(n)) %>% slice(1:10) %>% kable()
```
OutKast was the most popular artist played during the graveyard shift, followed by the beatles, and then Led Zeppelin.I guess it was mostly old music and classics that was played during that time range, while modern music would have been played while people were at the hall.




## Question 4:

We want to compare the volatility of 

* bitcoin prices
* gold prices

Let our measure of volatility be the relative change from day-to-day in price. 
Let the reference currency be US dollars. Analyze these results and provide
insight to a foreign currency exchanger.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
gold<- Quandl("WGC/GOLD_DAILY_USD", start_date="2010-07-17")%>% tbl_df()
bitcoin <- Quandl("BAVERAGE/USD") %>% tbl_df()
bitcoin <- rename(bitcoin, Avg = `24h Average`, Total.Volume = `Total Volume`)
currency <- left_join(bitcoin, gold, by = "Date")
ggplot(data = currency, aes(x = Date)) +
geom_line(aes(x = Date, y = Avg), colour = "blue") +
geom_line(aes(x = Date, y = Value), colour = "red") +
labs(title = "Variation in Average Currency Prices", x = "Date",y = "Average Price for Day (Dollars)")
bitcoin_diff <- diff(currency$Avg)
gold_diff <- diff(currency$Value)
```
Bitcoin is the blue, and Gold is the red. We see that bitcoin first becomes popular as an exchange in 2013, and it rose until 2014. However as it gained popularity questions probably arose as to its legitimacy and its connection with shady activities such as "The silk road" decreasing its exchange value. It is also a lot lower compared to gold, which has the confidence of investors and legitimacy behind it.




## Question 5:

Using the data loaded from Quandl below, plot a time series using `geom_line()`
comparing cheese and milk production in the US from 1930 to today. Comment on this.

* Cheese [page](https://www.quandl.com/data/USDANASS/NASS_CHEESEPRODUCTIONMEASUREDINLB-Cheese-Production-Measured-In-Lb)
* Milk [page](https://www.quandl.com/data/USDANASS/NASS_MILKPRODUCTIONMEASUREDINLB-Milk-Production-Measured-In-Lb)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
cheese <- Quandl("USDANASS/NASS_CHEESEPRODUCTIONMEASUREDINLB") %>% 
  tbl_df()
milk <-  Quandl("USDANASS/NASS_MILKPRODUCTIONMEASUREDINLB") %>% 
  tbl_df()
```
