## Admistrative:

Please indicate

* Who you collaborated with:Christian, Kyler
* Roughly how much time you spent on this HW:7hrs
* What gave you the most trouble:Number 1 gave me the most trouble. Particularly understanding the exploratory data analysis,and fitting the logistic regression. I think the rest went fine.Also there were some problems when I published it, with some of the spacing between the words and the margins. My R crashed and I think was re-updated so that might have been part of the problem.
* Any comments you have: 


## Data

* You must first copy the file `profiles.csv` from `HW-2` to the `data` folder
in the `HW-3` directory
* We also consider all 222,540 songs played in the Reed College pool hall
jukebox from Nov 30, 2003 to Jan 22, 2009 (included in `HW-3` folder). 

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# DO NOT EDIT THIS SECTION!
profiles <- read.csv("data/profiles.csv", header=TRUE) %>% 
  tbl_df()
jukebox <- read.csv("data/jukebox.csv", header=TRUE) %>% 
  tbl_df()
```





## Question 1:

For this question we will be picking up from where we left off in HW-2,
specifically the OkCupid dataset.


### a)

Using your exploratory data analysis from HW-2, fit a logistic regression to
predict individual's gender and interpret your results.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
profiles1 <- mutate(profiles, is_female = ifelse(sex == "f", 1, 0))
smokes <- profiles1 %>% 
select(smokes, is_female) %>% 
group_by(smokes) %>% 
mutate(sum = sum(is_female),
prop_female = mean(is_female)) %>% 
distinct(smokes) %>% 
arrange(prop_female)
modeldata <- profiles1 %>% 
mutate(does_smoke = ifelse(smokes %in% c("yes", "sometimes","when drinking","trying to quit"), 1, 0))
#health_edu_cler = ifelse(job %in% c("medicine / health", "education / academia", "clerical / administrative"), 1, 0)) %>%     
#na.omit(height)

model2 <- glm(is_female ~ does_smoke, data = modeldata, family = binomial(link = "logit"))
summary(model2)
```

My results show that for every 1 of an increase in the indicator that they smoke. There is a odds of .21 that the person is male.

### b)

Plot a histogram of the fitted probabilities $\widehat{p}_i$ for all users $i=1,
\ldots, n=59946$ in your dataset.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
p_hat <- fitted(model2)
ggplot(data = NULL, aes(x = p_hat)) +
geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2, col="green", 
fill="blue", 
alpha = .2) +geom_vline(xintercept = 0.5, col = "black") +
labs(title = "Fitted Probabilities Histogram", x = "P hat", y = "OK Cupid Users")
co <- coefficients(model2)
hist(fitted(model2))
```


### c)

Use a *decision threshold* of $p^*=0.5$ to make an explicit prediction for each
user $i$'s sex and save this in a variable `predicted_sex`. In other words, for user $i$

* If $\widehat{p}_i > p^*$, set `predicted_sex = 1` i.e. they are female
* If $\widehat{p}_i < p^*$, set `predicted_sex = 0` i.e. they are male

Display a 2 x 2 contigency table of `sex` and `predicted_sex` i.e. compare the 
predicted sex to the actual sex of all users. The sum of all the elements in
your table should be $n=59946$. Comment on how well our predictions fared.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
fit_pred <- c()
for(i in 1:59946) {
if(!is.na(p_hat [i])){
if(p_hat[i] >= 0.5) {
fit_pred[i] <- 1
 }
if(p_hat[i] < 0.5) {
fit_pred[i] <- 0
}
}else{
fit_pred[i] <- NA
}
}
profiles$pred_female <- fit_pred
obs <- profiles1  %>% group_by(is_female)  %>% tally()
pred <-profiles1  %>% group_by(is_female)  %>% tally()
contingency <- matrix(nrow = 4, ncol = 2)
colnames(contingency) <- c("Actual", "Predicted")
rownames(contingency) <- c("Male", "Female", "Unknown", "Sum")
contingency[1,1] <- obs[1,2][[1]]
contingency[2,1] <- obs[2,2][[1]]
contingency[4,1] <- contingency[1,1] + contingency[2,1]
contingency[1,2] <- pred[1,2][[1]]
contingency[2,2] <- pred[2,2][[1]]
contingency[3,2] <- pred[3,2][[1]]
contingency[4,2] <- contingency[1,2] + contingency[2,2] + contingency[3,2]
kable(as.data.frame(contingency))
```

Still had problems with this. It predicted everyone as male.Then it just ran the same predictions as observed.

### d)

Say we wanted to have a **false positive rate** of about 20%, i.e. of the people
we predicted to be female, we want to be wrong no more than 20% of the time. What
decision threshold $p^*$ should we use?

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

```





## Question 2:

Using the jukebox data, plot a time series of the number of songs played each
week over the entire time period. i.e.

* On the x-axis present actual dates (not something like Week 93, which doesn't 
mean anything to most people).
* On the y-axis present the total number of songs.

What seasonal (i.e. cyclical) patterns do you observe?

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
jukebox <- jukebox %>% mutate(Date_format = parse_date_time(date_time, "%b %d %H%M%S %y"))
jukebox1<- jukebox[ -c(7,8) ]  
jukebox1 <- jukebox1 %>% separate(Date_format, c("Date", "Time"), sep = " ")
jukebox1 <- jukebox1 %>% mutate(week = week(Date))
jukebox1 <- jukebox1 %>% mutate(year = year(Date))
songsperweek <- jukebox1  %>% group_by(year, week)  %>% tally() 
songsperweek$date <- as.Date(paste(songsperweek$year, 
songsperweek$week, 1, sep="-"), "%Y-%U-%u")
ggplot(data = songsperweek, aes(x = date, y = n)) +
geom_area() +
labs(title = "Songs Played per Week", x = "Date",y = "Number of Songs")
songsperweek <- songsperweek %>% mutate(month = month(date)) %>% select(month,n)
winter <- c(12, 1, 2)
spring <- c(3, 4, 5)
summer <- c(6, 7, 8)
autumn <- c(9, 10, 11)
songsbyseason <- songsperweek %>% 
mutate(season= 
ifelse(month %in% winter, 'winter', 
ifelse(month %in% spring, 'spring', 
ifelse(month %in% summer, 'summer', 
ifelse(month %in% autumn, 'autumn', NA)))))
ggplot(data = songsbyseason, aes(x = season, y = n)) +
geom_boxplot() +labs(title = "Songs Played by Season", x= "Season",y = "Number of Songs")

```

The largest range of songs played during a season was in winter. Also the shortest range was in the summer.However on average there were more songs played during the summer than any other season.




## Question 3:

Using the jukebox data, what are the top 10 artists played during the "graveyard
shift" during the academic year? Define

* the "graveyard shift" as midnight to 8am
* the academic year as September through May (inclusive)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
jukebox1 <- jukebox1 %>% mutate(month = month(Date))
academic <- c(9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
academic_songs <- jukebox1 %>% mutate(academic = ifelse(month %in% academic, 'academic', 'break')) %>% 
filter(academic == "academic")
academic_songs <- academic_songs %>% filter(Time > "00:00:00", Time < "08:00:00")
academic_songs %>% group_by(artist) %>% 
tally() %>% arrange(desc(n)) %>% slice(1:10) %>% kable()
```

OutKast was the most popular artist played during the graveyard shift, followed by the beatles, and then Led Zeppelin.I guess it was mostly old music and classics that was played during that time range, while modern music would have been played while people were at the hall.




## Question 4:

We want to compare the volatility of 

* bitcoin prices
* gold prices

Let our measure of volatility be the relative change from day-to-day in price. 
Let the reference currency be US dollars. Analyze these results and provide
insight to a foreign currency exchanger.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
gold<- Quandl("WGC/GOLD_DAILY_USD", start_date="2010-07-17")%>% tbl_df()
bitcoin <- Quandl("BAVERAGE/USD") %>% tbl_df()
bitcoin <- rename(bitcoin, Avg = `24h Average`, Total.Volume = `Total Volume`)
currency <- left_join(bitcoin, gold, by = "Date")
ggplot(data = currency, aes(x = Date)) +
geom_line(aes(x = Date, y = Avg), colour = "blue") +
geom_line(aes(x = Date, y = Value), colour = "red") +
labs(title = "Variation in Average Currency Prices", x = "Date",y = "Average Price for Day (Dollars)")
bitcoin_diff <- diff(currency$Avg)
gold_diff <- diff(currency$Value)
bitcoin <- na.omit(bitcoin)
gold <- na.omit(gold)
gold <- gold %>% 
mutate(percentchange_gold= (((Value/lag(Value))-1)*100))
bitcoin <- bitcoin %>% 
mutate(percentchange_bitcoin= (((Avg/lag(Avg))-1)*100))
currensy1 <- left_join(bitcoin, gold, by = "Date") %>% 
mutate(diff_in_vol = (percentchange_bitcoin-percentchange_gold))
bigplot <- ggplot(currensy1, aes(Date))
bigplot + geom_line(aes(y = percentchange_bitcoin, colour = "BTC")) +  
geom_line(aes(y = percentchange_gold, colour = "Gold")) +
labs(title="Daily Volatily from Previous Price, GOLD, BTC")

```

Bitcoin is the blue, and Gold is the red. We see that bitcoin first becomes popular as an exchange in 2013, and it rose until 2014. However as it gained popularity questions probably arose as to its legitimacy and its connection with shady activities such as "The silk road" decreasing its exchange value. 

In the second graph we see that bitcoin is a lot more volatile than gold.





## Question 5:

Using the data loaded from Quandl below, plot a time series using `geom_line()`
comparing cheese and milk production in the US from 1930 to today. Comment on this.

* Cheese [page](https://www.quandl.com/data/USDANASS/NASS_CHEESEPRODUCTIONMEASUREDINLB-Cheese-Production-Measured-In-Lb)
* Milk [page](https://www.quandl.com/data/USDANASS/NASS_MILKPRODUCTIONMEASUREDINLB-Milk-Production-Measured-In-Lb)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
cheese <- Quandl("USDANASS/NASS_CHEESEPRODUCTIONMEASUREDINLB") %>% 
  tbl_df()
milk <-  Quandl("USDANASS/NASS_MILKPRODUCTIONMEASUREDINLB") %>% 
  tbl_df()
```
